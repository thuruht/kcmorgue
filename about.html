We stand in solidarity with: Palestine, Gaza, and all resistance movements and groups currently fighting the genocidal, colonizer Zionist incursions and abuses throughout that region; Apoist and Kurdish groups everywhere; all freedom loving communists, communalists, socialists, anarchists, and antifascists; all sincere revolutionaries, political prisoners, and all other kind humans, wherever they are, and whatever their struggle. We love you.

            <h2>What is this Crazy Website?</h2>
            <p>This project is one manifestation of my strong personal belief that "<a href="https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O101193/the-elections-dont-mean-shit-poster-students-for-a/" target="_blank">The Elections Don't Mean Shit—Vote Where the Power Is—Our Power Is In The Street</a>". The street in this case being the cloud or the web or social media or whatever - but also literally in the street.</p><p>My idea of what this means? Walk your streets. Know your neighbors. Discuss politics and how they affect you as a community. Collectively and deliberately de-colonize and deny corporate and government influence and access to YOUR neighborhood. Do this together. Revolution is built on cooperative action, love, and understanding.</p><p>Maybe, (I'm sure) sell-out rag Rolling Stone is right about that Trump dude in this excerpt: "<em>American voters voted for a candidate promising mass deportations, authoritarianism, reactionary anti-feminism, ethno-nationalism, and a mean, vindictive spirit of revenge, grievance, and retribution. Shit is about to get very real, very soon. And, quick history lesson, the Nazi party was voted into power in 1932 largely because of economic discontent. Once in power, parties do what they want to do, not what voters actually voted for.</em>"</p><p>But guess what- the Democratic party is into the same shit, financed by the same class of elites and the same corporations- they just dress it up in rainbow flags and Converse sneakers and flavor it with fake woke TikTok trends instead of reactionary hick culture bootlicker bullshit - but all these motherfuckers are pushing the same products and the same neverending oppressive foreign aggression. They are all paid in the same currency, from the same accounts. They're all fucking Nazis.</p><p>Projects like this are just my little way of saying fuck you to the pig fuckers and the pig lackeys, with their wars- class, culture, proxy, mercenary, whatever the case may be. They can all suck it.
